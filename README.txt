Homeworks and projectAI

Hi.
My name is Valerio Longo and i'm a student of computer science in Sapienza.
This is a repository for Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence. It contains some homeworks and the final project.

This final project (projectAI) is about a Ros simple action server and client and the usage of Gmapping module on MARRtino robot.
The scope of this little project is:
  -Scanning the map with laser turning 360Â°
  -Using "publish point" on RVIZ,the user gives 3 waypoint and the robot will get in if the are no obstacles.
  -if it find obstacles, it will stop.
  
I've added a module for debugging called joy_teleop_button. So if u want to use a joystick to start or stopping the robot you can do it.

Enjoy.
